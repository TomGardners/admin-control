# remotely restarts a PC on the network #
- the confirmation ping test doesn't work 100%, i need to learn to use throw and catch errors to turn it into something that looks nice while the PC is starting again
- needs to say who is currently logged in > if no one, it needs to say this
- after it's found the PC and asks for confirmation it should tell me how long the PC has been switched on for
